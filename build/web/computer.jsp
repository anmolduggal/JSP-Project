    <div id="demo">
	<p>For the first time in India under graduate course in Computer Science and Engineering was offered in 1977 under Electrical Engineering Department with a modest strength of 10 students.  Over the years it has established itself into a separate department. The department with the passage of its evolution and growth has succeeded in creating its place of excellence not only within the Institute but among its counterparts in the country and abroad. It has been attracting bright students from all parts of the country for quality education in computer science at under graduate, post graduate and doctoral levels. During the course of time it has offered opportunities to its inmates in the area of quality education, research in pursuance of a long cherished mission of the department.</p>

<p>The computer Science Engineering Department offers  courses leading to a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering, and Information Technology. It also offers a Master of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering, Master of of Technology in Software Engineering, Master of of Technology in Information Security, and Master of Computer Application (M.C.A.). Further, the department also enrolls candidates for Ph.D. .The department has qualified and experienced faculty in the areas of Computer Architecture, Database Systems, Image Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Wireless and Sensor Networks, Computer Networks,  and Software Engineering. There is close interaction between the Computer Science & Engineering Department and various other departments like Electrical Engineering and Electronics & Communication Engineering in the field of teaching and research.</p>
<h3><b><u>DEPARTMENT MISSION</u></b></h3>
<p>The Department Computer Science & Engineering has following missions<br>
