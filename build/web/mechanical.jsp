    <div id="demo">
    <p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering is one of the oldest (started in 1961) and the largest department in terms of faculty, students and activities at MNNIT, Allahabad. The department is broadly divided into the following three academic streams:</p>

     <p>Design Engineering</p>
     <p>Production and Industrial Engineering</p>
     <p>Thermal Engineering</p>


     <p>The department offers B.Tech., M.Tech. and Ph.D. programs with a wide choice of specializations, electives and research areas. The Department offers two Bachelor of Technology programmes in - </p>

    <h4>Mechanical Engineering</h4>
    <h4>Production and Industrial Engineering.</h4>


    <p>Every year 169 students are admitted through JEE (Mains) and 15% of this intake is through Direct Admission to Students Abroad (DASA) scheme for the above two programmes. Some students are also admitted through ICCR and MEA (Govt. of India) schemes.</p>

    <p>The Department is running four semester Master of Technology programmes in Mechanical Engineering with specialization in -</p> 

    <h6>Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing</h6>
    <h6>Design Engineering</h6>
    <h6>Production Engineering</h6>
    <h6>Product Design and Development</h6>
    <h6>Thermal Engineering.</h6>


    <p>About 80 students (16 in each specialization) join the above programmes.  The strength of the department lies in its Ph.D. programme with about 82 Ph.Ds already been awarded. About 57 research scholars are presently pursuing their Ph.Ds. Every year the department admits Ph.D. students equal to half of the number of faculty holding Ph.D. degree.</p>

    <p>The department is having highly qualified and experienced faculty in all streams of Mechanical Engineering. About 88% of the faculty members have doctoral degrees and the rest are pursuing their Ph.Ds.</p>

    <p>Today, the world of Mechanical Engineering changes under the influence of advanced computational tools, improved simulation and analysis, and entirely different manufacturing protocols. This has opened up new vistas of research in the department, such as Fracture Mechanics, Rapid Prototyping, Computational Heat Transfer, Solar Energy, Advanced Materials, Supply Chain Management, Advanced Manufacturing Processes, CAD/CAM/CIM, Robotics and Mechatronics, Operations Management, Energy Management, and Control Engineering.</p>

 

    <h3>Vision of the Department</h3>

    <p>To be a centre of excellence in Mechanical Engineering education and research for the benefit of global society and humanity.</p>

 

    <h4>Mission of the Department</h4>
